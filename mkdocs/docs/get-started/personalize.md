# Personalize workspace

To facilitate seamless switching between workspaces, personalizing each workspace can be very useful. This includes customizing its 
name, description, fonts, colors, and icons. By tailoring these aspects to your preferences, you can create a more 
intuitive and visually appealing workspace environment that suits your needs.
