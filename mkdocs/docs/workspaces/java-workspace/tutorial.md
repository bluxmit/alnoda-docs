This basic tutorial demonstrates how to create Java Hello-world application, and use Maven or Gradle to install 
dependnecies and build applications.

## Hello world

```
java -version
```

Open IDE and create file `Main.java` with the following content

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

Use terminal to compile and execute

```
cd /home/project
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Maven

Maven helps with:

- Making the build process easy
- Providing a uniform build system
- Providing quality project information
- Encouraging better development practices

Check Maven version in terminal

```
mvn -v
```

Build Java code

```
cp -r /home/abc/example /home/project/example 
cd /home/project/example
mvn compile
```

This will run Maven, telling it to execute the compile goal. When itâ€™s finished, you should find the compiled .class files in the target/classes directory.   

Run the package goal

```
mvn package
```

To execute the JAR file run

```
java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar
```

# Gradle

Copy example project

```
cp -r /home/abc/example /home/project/example 
cd /home/project/example
```

Check Gradle installation, run Gradle from the command-line

```
cd /home/project/example
gradle
```

Initialize Gradle

```
gradle init
```

Now that Gradle is installed, see what it can do

```
gradle tasks
```

Build project with Gradle

```
gradle build
```
