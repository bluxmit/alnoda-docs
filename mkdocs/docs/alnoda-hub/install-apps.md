To add application in Alnoda Hub you need to go to your users's page and then to _'collection'_ from where you can register new apps and workspaces.

    You do not need account in the Alnoda Hub to install applications

You can also install any of the apps created by you or other people. To install an app you need to execute a single command in the workspace terminal 

```
wrk install [app-id]==[app-version]
```

You can find the command on every application page in the Alnoda Hub. For example to install Nginx
