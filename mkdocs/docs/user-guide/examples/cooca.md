# Cooka - manage machine learning datasets and experiments

## Intro

In this example we are going to add [Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) to the workspace as a permanent workspace application.   

[Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) is a lightweight and visualization toolkit to manage datasets and design 
model learning experiments through web UI.  


[Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) can be installed in any workspace. We will use __Theia workspace__ in this example.  

[Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) is a python application with a graphical browser-based user interface.   

We will install [Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) python package, add [Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) 
as a permanent workspace application, and create [Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) shortcut in the workspace UI page.   

## Requirements 

Before installing Cooca, we need to install several dependencies.   

Install tensorflow - is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.

$ pip install pyarrow==2.0.0

## Install 

[Cooka](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/Cooka) is a python package. It can be installed with either __pip__ or [__pipx__](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).  

There is an advantage of using [__pipx__](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) - with pipx we install and run Python applications in an 
isolated environments. This will prevent package conflicts with any other Python application that we might install in future.  

To install Cooka, execute the next command. __NOTE: this will take several minutes__
<div class="termy">
```bash
$ pip install cooka

  installed package cooka 0.1.5, installed using Python 3.8.10
  These apps are now globally available
    - cooka
