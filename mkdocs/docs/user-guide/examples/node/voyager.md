# Voyager - data exploration tool

## Intro

In this example we are going to add [__Voyager__](https://github.com/vega/voyager) to the workspace as a permanent workspace application.    

[__Voyager__](https://github.com/vega/voyager) is a data exploration tool with a browser-based user interface that blends manual and automated chart specification.     

![voyager](img/voyager.jpg)

!!! attention
    [__Voyager__](https://github.com/vega/voyager) can be installed in any workspace. We will use __Theia workspace v.4.0__ in this example.

Voyager is a Javascript application. We will clone code repository, install dependencies and build Voyager.  

!!! note
    We will create isolated node environment, istall Voyager dependencies and build Voyager in it.   
    Then we will start it in a permanent way, and add a Voyager card to the workspace UI Home tab.   

## Requirements

First thing is to install python2. Voyager has rather outdated dependencies. 
Luckily workspace is completely isolated, and this won't affect you main environment.  

Open workspace terminal and execute the next commands

<div class="termy">
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y python2

Preparing to unpack .../python2_2.7.17-2ubuntu4_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking python2 (2.7.17-2ubuntu4) ...
Setting up libpython2.7-stdlib:amd64 (2.7.18-1~20.04.3) ...
Setting up python2.7 (2.7.18-1~20.04.3) ...
Setting up libpython2-stdlib:amd64 (2.7.17-2ubuntu4) ...
Setting up python2 (2.7.17-2ubuntu4) ...

```
</div>

## Build

Now, clone Voyager GitHub repository, and go into it

<div class="termy">
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vega/voyager.git ~/apps/voyager

$ cd ~/apps/voyager

with <font color="#FDEB61">abc</font> in <font color="#37E6E8">~/apps/voyager</font> on <font color="#BC94B7">â‡¡master</font> <font color="#98E242">âžœ</font>
```
</div>

Let's create an isolate node environment. Separate environment will prevent dependencies conflicts with other applications 
that we might want to install in the workspace later.    

<div class="termy">
```
$ nodeenv --node=12.18.3 env

with <font color="#FDEB61">abc</font> in <font color="#37E6E8">~/apps/voyager</font> on <font color="#BC94B7">â‡¡master</font> <font color="#98E242">âžœ</font> <font color="#5EA702">nodeenv</font> --node=12.18.3 env
 * Install prebuilt node (12.18.3) ..... done.
```
</div>

Activate this environment

<div class="termy">
```
$ . env/bin/activate

(env) 18:11:21 with <font color="#FDEB61">abc</font> in <font color="#37E6E8">~/apps/voyager</font> on <font color="#BC94B7">â‡¡master</font> ðŸ“¦ <font color="#F54235">v2.0.0-alpha.24</font> via <font color="#99E343">â¬¢ v12.18.3</font> <font color="#98E242">âžœ</font> 
```
</div>

Install yarn

<div class="termy">
```
$ npm install -g yarn

+ yarn@1.22.19

```
</div>

Install all required packages

<div class="termy">

$ yarn

</div>

Build Voyager

<div class="termy">
```
$ yarn build

Done in 144.69s.
```
</div>

## Run

We have built voyager, now we can start it

<div class="termy">
```
$ yarn start

<font color="#3C6894">â„¹</font> <font color="#646562">ï½¢wdmï½£</font>: Compiled successfully.
```
</div>

Voyager listens to the port 9000. You can open another terminal and run `curl localhost:9000` to check 
if Voyager is up and running.  

But now we cannot access Voyager bescides the terminal. The workspace exposes port range 8020-8040. 
Lets create port tunneling from port 9000 to 8030, so that we could open Voyager in browser like any other application.   

Open new terminal window, and execute

<div class="termy">
```
$ socat tcp-listen:8030,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:9000

<font color="#646562">_</font>
```
</div>

Now we can open Voyager from the "My-apps" tab on the workspace UI.   

![voyager run](img/voyager-run.gif) 

We can work with Voyager now! But as soon as we close the terminal, Voyager will stop too.  

It would be much more convenient if we didn't need to start Voyager from the terminal each time. Voyager should kept running 
even after we close the terminal session, and even after we restart the workspace.   

To make this happen, we need to add Voyager (together with the port tunneling) as a permanent workspace application 
via the workspace settings page.  


## Add to workspace

Let's add Voyager as a permanent workspace application. Go to the "Admin" tab, open "Workspace Settings" and go to "Apps & Services".  

Here we can add new applications to the workspace. To do this we need to provide the command that sarts an application or service, 
and give this service a name.  

Let's first create an entry for Voyager. Select "START NEW" from the picklist, enter any name and paste this command

```
cd ~/apps/voyager; . env/bin/activate; yarn start
```

This commad will start Voyager. It consist of 3 sub-commands, separated by semicolon: 
go to voyager folder, activate environment and start application.  

![start voyager](img/start-voyager.jpg)

Let's also start the port tunneling, which will map voyager's port 9000 to the port 8032. The latter is in the exposed range, hence it 
can be accessed.   

Select "START NEW" from the picklist, enter any name and paste this command

```
socat tcp-listen:8032,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:9000
```

Let's restart the workspace for new applications to start.  

## Update UI

Finally, let's add Voyager shortcut to the workspace UI. This will allow us to open Voyager directly from the worspace UI page.   

Shortcut has title, description and image. Use filebrowser or IDE to upload any image intto the workspace. 
You can choose whatever you like, one option - is to create a printscreen of the Voyager app itself.  

After you upload the image to the workspace, go to the "Interface" tab of the workspace settings and select "CREATE NEW" from the picklist.   

![start voyager](img/voyager-ui.jpg)

Give it any title and description. In the field "Port" enter port 8032. Leave field "path" blank. Then select your image.   

Now we have Voyager tab on the Home page of the workspace. 

![voyager ui](img/workspace-ui-voyager.jpg)

## Result

Voyager was permanently added to the workspace. If we stop and then start workspace, Voyager will be started too.  

Any new workspace we create from this workspace will have Voyager too.
