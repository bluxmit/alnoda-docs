# Kakoune - a better code editor 

## Intro 

In this example we will install [__Kakoune__](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune#22-installing) - a code editor that implements Viâ€™s 
"keystrokes as a text editing language" model.  

As it is also a modal editor, it is somewhat similar to the Vim editor (after which Kakoune was originally inspired).

## Install

The first thing is to update the package lists. Open workspace terminal and run  

<div class="termy">
```
$ sudo apt-get update

Now we can install Kakoune with Apt package manager 

<div class="termy">
```
$ sudo apt install -y kakoune

[__Kakoune__](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune#22-installing) was installed in the workspace.  

## Use
