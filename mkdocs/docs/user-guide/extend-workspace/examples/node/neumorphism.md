# Neumorphism  - note taking web app

## Intro

In this example we are going to add [__Neumorphism__](https://github.com/adamgiebl/neumorphism) to the workspace.    

Neumorphism ia s CSS code generator for a new popular design trend called Neumorphism/Soft UI.  

![neumorhism](img/neumorphism.jpg)

!!! attention
    Neumorphism can be installed in any workspace. We will use __Extended workspace v.4.0__ in this example.

!!! note
    We will create isolated node environment for Neumorphism and its dependencies.  
    Then we will start it in a permanent way, and add Neumorphism tab shortcut to the workspace UI.  

## Install 

Open workspace terminal, clone Neumorphism git repository and enter it

<div class="termy">
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adamgiebl/neumorphism.git /home/abc/apps/neumorphism

```
</div>


Create node enviroment and activate it

<div class="termy">
```
$ nodeenv --node=18.9.0 env && . env/bin/activate

 * Install prebuilt node (18.9.0) ..... done.

```
</div>


Install dependencies

<div class="termy">
```
$ npm install

...

```
</div>


## Run

Start Neumorphism application

<div class="termy">
```
$ npm start

...
Search for the keywords to learn more about each warning.
To ignore, add // eslint-disable-next-line to the line before.
```
</div>

The application has started and listens to the port 3000.  

Workspace exposes port range 8020-8040, lets create a tunnel from port 3000 to any of the free ports in the workspace port range. 
You can find free port on the "About" tab in the workspace UI page.  

Lets tunnel port 8030 to port 3000. Ope another terminal widow and execute 

<div class="termy">
```
$ socat tcp-listen:8030,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:3000

```
</div>

Now we can use shorcut "My app on port 8030" from the "My apps" tab to open Neumorphism

## Add to workspace

We can use Neuromorphism now. But it was started from the terminal. As soon as we close the terminal, Neuromorphism process will terminalte. 
It is inconvenient to start Neuromorphism via terminal command (together with socat) every time we want to use it.  

It would be more convenient if we didn't have to start Neuromorphism from the terminal each time. Neuromorphism should start 
automatically with all other workspace applications every time we start the workspace.     

Let's add Neuromorphism as a permanent workspace application: 

- [X] Open "Admin" tab oo the workspace UI and avigate to "Workspace Settings" 
- [X] Go to the tab "Apps & Services"
- [X] Select "START NEW" from the picklist 
- [X] Enter the following command 

```
cd /home/abc/apps/neumorphism; . env/bin/activate; npm start
``` 
This command consists of 3 parts: 1) go to the Neumorphism repo, 2) activate node environment, 3) start Neumorphism

- [X] Give it any name you want 
- [X] Click "Save"

![neumorphism-start](img/neumorphism-start.jpg)

Now let's create service for the port tuneling as well

- [X] Select "START NEW" from the picklist 
- [X] Enter the following command 

```
socat tcp-listen:8032,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:3000
``` 
This time we will forward traffic from port 3000 to 8032 - one of the workspace free ports.

- [X] Give it any name you want 
- [X] Click "Save"

Please restart workspace to apply changes.


## Create UI tab 

Let's add Neumorphism shortcut tab to the workspace "Home" page.   

Shortcut tab has title, description and image. Use filebrowser or IDE to upload any image you want into the workspace. 
You can choose whatever you like, one option - is to create a printscreen of the Neumorphism app itself.  

After you upload the image to the workspace

- [X] Go to the "Interface" tab of the workspace settings and select "CREATE NEW" from the picklist.   
- [X] Give it any title and description. 
- [X] In the field "Port" enter port 8032 - the port we used to forward traffic from port 3000
- [X] In the file picker find your image.   
- [X] Leave field "path" blank and click "Create"

Now we have Neumorphism tab on the Home page

## Result

Neumorphism was installed and permanently added to the workspace. If we stop and then start workspace, neumorphism will start too.
