# Python applications 

The best way to install Python applications in the workspaces is pipx. [__Pipx__](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a utility for 
installing and running Python applications in isolated environments. It's useful when you want to use a Python-based application, 
but you want to avoid installing it and its dependencies into your global Python environment.

!!! info 
    Pipx is installed in every Alnoda workspace by default.
     
You can use pipx to install applications from PyPi. 

For example, let's install [__awesome-finder__](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-finder/):

<div class="termy">
```
$ pipx install awesome-finder

  installed package awesome-finder 1.2.3, installed using Python 3.8.10
  These apps are now globally available
    - awesome-hub
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```
</div>

You can now explore awesome resources from various programming languages. For instance:

<div class="termy">
```
<font color="#5EA702">awesome-hub</font> python
```
</div>
