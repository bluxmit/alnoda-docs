workspace, regardless of their physical location. They can code, test, and see the results in real time without needing to go through 
the time-consuming process of deploying the application after every change. This feature greatly enhances team collaboration and 
enables a faster iteration cycle, both of which are crucial for startups aiming to move fast and adapt quickly.
- [x] Easy prototype demonstration: Alnoda workspaces also facilitate the demonstration of prototypes to potential customers or 
investors. You can provide access to your workspace over the internet, allowing external stakeholders to interact with your 
application directly within the workspace. This eliminates the need for setting up a separate demonstration environment or worrying 
about software compatibility issues on the recipient's end. It also provides a more immersive experience for the viewer, 
which can help in getting more valuable feedback or convincing potential investors.

## Process optimisation
All businesses grapple with the task of automating and optimizing their business processes and IT operations. This often includes 
activities such as data exchange and reporting between departments, statistical analysis, A/B testing, data synchronization between 
disparate systems, web scraping, black-box testing, and more. Alnoda workspaces can greatly simplify these operations:

- [x] Fast and efficient automation of online scripts. By running workspaces in your cloud infrastructure, you can write automation 
scripts online and schedule them without the need for any CI/CD or deployment processes. This approach can significantly speed up 
experimentation and automation efforts, often proving sufficient for process automation and operational optimization.
- [x] Data sharing via the workspace Filebrowser. Alnoda workspaces offer the ability to share data with other teams using the built-in 
Filebrowser. This feature facilitates seamless data exchange between teams, making collaboration more effective and efficient.
