# Use-cases

Alnoda workspaces offer containerized environments for a wide range of IT specialists, including software developers, data analysts, 
DevOps professionals, site reliability engineers, data scientists, cloud infrastructure engineers, data engineers, and more. 
By leveraging Alnoda workspaces, users can enjoy numerous benefits and advantages. Dockerized workspaces can be especially useful 
in the following cases.

## Distributed team
Distributed software development teams frequently encounter difficulties related to communication, coordination, and the knowledge sharing. 
You can use Alnoda workspaces to alleviate some of these issues

- [x] Configure the workspace environment once and all team members can replicate it exactly, eliminating the classic "it works on my machine" 
problem. The workspace encapsulates everything needed to run the application - code, runtime, system tools, libraries - ensuring 
consistency across various setups.
- [x] Onboard newcomers faster. Alnoda workspaces can significantly reduce the time needed to onboard new team members. 
Instead of spending time setting up their development environment, downloading dependencies, and aligning their setup with the 
existing team's setup, newcomers can simply pull the pre-configured container and be up and running quickly. This not 
only expedites their ability to contribute to the project but also ensures they have the exact same setup as existing team members.
- [x] Share your workspace with your teammates and collaborate efficiently. Whether you're operating your workspace in the cloud 
or on your personal laptop, granting access to your workspace terminal or any workspace applications to your team members 
is straightforward. This simplifies the process of coding in the same IDE, experimenting within the same Jupyter notebook, 
seeking guidance from a more experienced colleague, or showcasing your work outcomes without needing to take any additional steps.
