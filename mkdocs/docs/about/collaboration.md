# Improve collaboration

Alnoda workspaces have the potential to enhance the productivity of your team, foster better collaboration with stakeholders, 
streamline the process of showcasing outcomes to your employer, and accelerate the integration of your open-source project.

## Code together 
The most seamless approach to collaborative work involves initiating a workspace on a cloud server or within a Kubernetes cluster. 
This method enables you and your team to access the same workspace via a browser, allowing all members to utilize workspace 
applications such as code editors, notebooks, file browsers, or terminals. 

There's no immediate requirement to initiate your workspace on a cloud server. You always have the option to halt your local 
workspace and then restart it on the server. The Alnoda desktop app will manage the synchronization process.

## Share local workspace

A unique feature of Alnoda workspaces is the ability to grant access to any workspace application over the Internet, 
even when running workspace locally on your personal computer.  

The process simply involves selecting the application 
you wish to share and forwarding a confidential link to your peer. Once your peer opens the link in their browser, 
they'll have direct access to the chosen workspace application.  

!!! note
    Alnoda workspaces have a unique feature that allows you to share your workspace online with your teammates __even when running workspace on your own laptop!__

This function is ideal for brief pairing sessions, showcasing accomplishments to your team during standups, 
aligning with stakeholders on completed features, sharing files and artifacts, or seeking assistance from a more experienced 
colleague when you encounter a roadblock.

## Preconfigured team workspaces
Collaboration and teamwork are also enhanced through containerized workspaces. Distributed teams can easily onboard new members 
by providing them with pre-configured workspaces, reducing setup time and ensuring consistent development environments for everyone.  

## Smart tools
The extendability of the workspaces helps with various unique collaboration requirements. For instance, professionals such as 
researchers, data scientists, or business intelligence engineers often need to share the results of regular research or analyses.

Configuring your workspace to carry out an automated analysis, scheduling its execution, and sharing the results via a file browser 
can be quite straightforward. Start by initiating your workspace on a cloud server. Next, write a script for automated analysis. 
Browse the Alnoda Hub and select from the numerous scheduling tools available, such as Cronicle, and add it to your workspace. 
You can also find user-interface tools, like Olive Tin, that trigger on-demand script execution. Your colleagues will then have 
the ability to download the results at a specific time or simply execute the analysis on-demand.

!!! info 
    The Alnoda Hub has hundreds of applications that can help with a wide array of requirements and use-cases.

## Create public workspace
Are you an author of an open-source framework or library? You may very well create a public workspace with all the system and programming language 
requirements installed, your package set up and pre-configured, and examples included. Doing so will make it easier for the community to explore and experiment with your new framework.
