    Containerized development environments provide significant benefits for working on multiple IT projects and seamless 
    switching between them. 

## Portability
One of the key advantages of Alnoda workspaces is their portability. Users can move workspaces from one computer to anoter, 
store on S3, docker registry, Google Drive and utilize them on any computer, eliminating the hassle of setting up complex development environments repeatedly.

ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted workflow.

## Experimentation
Another notable feature is the ability to conduct isolated experiments within containers. Each project can have its own dedicated 
container, allowing developers to experiment with different libraries, frameworks, and configurations without affecting their main 
development environment. This enables rapid prototyping, iterative development, and easy rollback to previous states, providing a 
flexible and risk-free environment for innovation.

Collaboration and teamwork are also enhanced through containerized workspaces. Distributed teams can easily onboard new members 
by providing them with pre-configured containers, reducing setup time and ensuring consistent development environments for everyone. 
Moreover, containers can be shared among team members, allowing for seamless collaboration and efficient knowledge sharing.
