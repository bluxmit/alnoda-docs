# Limitations
While Alnoda workspaces offer many important benefits, such as project isolation and workspace portability, they also have 
some constraints which limit their usage.

## Performance
Users engage with workspaces through a browser-based terminal and the workspace applications' browser-based interfaces. 
The speed of a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) and browser-based terminal tends to be slower than a native system terminal or native IDE. 

## Resource consumption
Workspaces are running within Docker containers, and this can consume more computer resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk space. 

## Limited GUI support 
Alnoda workspaces are primarily designed for command-line applications and browser-based applications. 
The current workspace design doesn't support running desktop applications with a graphical user interface within the workspaces. 
As a result, this restricts the potential to develop desktop applications or install them within the workspace environment.
